			<Description>
Welcome. The modlets contained here include Grow A Pair - Farm Life Expanded. A 'proof of concept' modlet featuring quality of life enhancements to add more features and content to the game. This started from our regular players
asking about old farming mods. I was asked if I could get these working for our server and this is my progress so far. I will also say... this is a learning process for myself, so things may be done differently.

FarmLifeMod2 and Farming Mod have been merged and some workstations and items are no longer used due to being duplicates, etc.
Unnecessary but Beautiful did not have any recipes at all in the copy I received. I've added simple recipes for all items for the time being.

I've added placeholder animals for more workstations and farming resources. The plans are to animate them in the future, but as they are now, they are stationary. Also, Not all new food items have actions applied at this time.


Special thanks to stasis78 (FarmLifeMod2), hernanxx (UnnecessarybutBeautiful) and Mayic (Farming Mod) for prior work on thier mods.

Extra special thanks to Linda, babygrl, Chris, Gator, Tru, Bluntz, David, Mistress Metal and Nomad for the initial help with everything to do with the farming mods.

Thank you to the 7 Days to Die modlet creators for adding so much content to the game.
